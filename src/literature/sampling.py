"""Deterministic corpus subsampling for expensive LLM stages.

The full bibliography is always complete; only the LLM-gated stages
(knowledge-graph extraction, reproducibility assessment) sample a
fraction of the corpus to keep runtime bounded.

Sampling is deterministic: the same corpus + same seed + same fraction
always produces the same subset. The sample is drawn by sorting papers
by ``canonical_id`` (stable order) and then selecting every
``1/fraction``-th paper with a seed-determined offset, so the selection
is reproducible without depending on dict iteration order or random
shuffle. This makes runs idempotent and resumable: a re-run with the
same config skips already-processed papers and processes the same new
ones.

    - **Determinism**: same input + same seed + same fraction = same output.
    - **Idempotency**: re-running with the same config produces the same
