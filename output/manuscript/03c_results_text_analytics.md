# Results: Language, Topics, and Embeddings

## RQ3: Topical and Linguistic Structure

Text analysis operates over titles, abstracts, and (when available) full text. A TF-IDF
representation over a 137-feature vocabulary feeds non-negative matrix
factorization, which extracts 5 latent topics cross-cutting the subfield
taxonomy. The top vocabulary terms are: atmospheric, uncertainty, spectra, temperature, abundance, coverage, opacity, sources, analysis, assumptions, observed, retrievals, models, stellar, across, evaluated, retrieval, structure, composition, jwst.

**Table 3. NMF topics extracted from the corpus.**

| Topic | Top terms |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | model, intervals, quantify, effect, noise, misspecification, record, data |
| 1 | population, harmonized, studies, reporting, preprocessing, require, metallicity, variation |
| 2 | atmospheric, abundance, opacity, changes, species, cloud, retrieved, assumptions |
| 3 | jwst, calibration, analyses, choices, reported, extend, characterization, wavelength |
| 4 | signals, instrument, astrophysical, alongside, modelled, systematics, contributions, high |

The topic labels are computed from the retained corpus and are not hand-assigned. Their
interpretation should be checked against the generated topic-term weights and the
configured subfield taxonomy; fixture-derived topics describe synthetic text patterns,
not the scientific field.

## Document Embeddings

Offline deterministic embeddings (TF-IDF followed by truncated SVD) place every document
in a shared 50-dimensional vector space. Embedding the same text twice yields identical
vectors, so the derived similarity matrix, nearest-neighbour lists, clusters, and
two-dimensional projection are all reproducible.

## Term Analysis

The TF-IDF term heatmap reveals which terms discriminate between subfields: terms with
high between-subfield variance (rather than high global mean) are selected for display.

## Named Entity Analysis

Named entity extraction over the 46 abstracts identified 1
unique entities. The most frequent entities reflect the retained corpus and the
configured extraction rules; source coverage and fixture status determine how they may
be interpreted.

| Entity | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| JWST | 15 |

## Embedding Similarity and Clustering

The TF-IDF/SVD embeddings place every document in a 50-dimensional vector space. K-means
clustering with $k = 5$ clusters partitions the corpus into
topically coherent groups. The top similar document pairs, ranked by cosine similarity,
reveal the most closely related works in the corpus.
